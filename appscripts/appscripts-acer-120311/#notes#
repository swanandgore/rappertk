Water and other HETATMS are ignored during the model building procedure. They are copied from the gien coordinate file into the output file at the end of a round of model building.
Only the standard amino acids and MSE are reccognised. All other modified reidues are treated as follows:
(1) If --use-ca-restraint False : The residue will be skipped and the program will attempt to link the adjoining residues.
(2) If --use-ca-restraint True : The residue will be skipped and will be treated as a chain break.
These residues will treated similar to a HETATM entry and will be copied into the output file at the end of the model building procedure.


NOTE ON MISSING ATOMS.
If calpha atoms are missing and --use-ca-restraints is set to true, then only residues for which ca-atoms are present in the coordinate file will be rebuilt. the residues with missing ca-atoms will treated as chain breaks howeer clash checks will be performed by keeping the atoms of these residues fixed.

If calpha atoms are missing and --use-ca-restraints is set to False, 
(1) If loopseq is not gien then all residues represented in the coordinate file within the range specified will be rebuilt.
(2) If loopseq is gien, residues will be rebuilt according the sequence and residue range specified.
